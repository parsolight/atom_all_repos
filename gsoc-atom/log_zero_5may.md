# Log entry until 5 May

After some searching around I found a [Node.js port to NaCl](https://github.com/codius/codius-nacl-node) which is a promising start. Next steps are, in order:

 - build the node.js to NaCl port, see if it works
 - reach out to the people who wrote it, discuss with them
 - find if it is fit for Atom
 
The communication method was established as once a week meeting coupled with Slack discussions and with a GitHub repo to hold logs.
